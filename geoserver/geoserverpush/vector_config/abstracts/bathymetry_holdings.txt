This dataset represents the current extent of bathymetry datasets held by AusSeabed as of January 2019. This dataset is live and will continue to be augmented as coverage is supplied from respective AusSeabed partners. Surveys have been conducted by a wide range of organisations and countries, both inside and outside of Australia's EEZ and for various purposes. Each polygon contains metadata describing the nature of data collection, including details of the survey, as well as the principle investigator of the project. Not all surveys are currently available for download; if available, the Data Access URL attribute will indicate how to access the survey data. Polygons are based on a 500m gridding of the survey data, so may not be representative of the true survey extent when viewed at large scale.
